**Summary**

This is my first project "Explore Weather Trends" for Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity. In this project, I analyze local (Houston) and global temperature data and compares local (Houston) temperature trends to overall global temperature trends.

To analysis temperature trends, SQL queries were written to extract the data from a database, moving averages calculations were performed to smooth data, data visualization were created using Excel. Finally, the report provides the similarities and differences between local (Houston) and global temperatures.

Overall conclusions for the temperature data analysis are:
* Both global and Houston are getting warmer.
* In the past 30 years, temperature changes significantly globally.
* Houston is much hotter in the world.
* During early time, Houston temperature is relatively stable.

**Objective**

* To get familiar with SQL, and practice to download data from a database. 
* To ceate a visualization using Excel and analyze local and global temperature data. 
* To accurately make four observations.
